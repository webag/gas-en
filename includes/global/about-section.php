					<p>The history of the company begin on 2004, when its main technical father was in the Space Forces of the Russian Federation. While studying and service with troops in the space forces, he took part in the initialization of the launch vehicles "UNION 2-1" and "PROTON M". Even then, the vector of development in the nature of air separation by a cryogenic method was outlined.</p>
					<p>The first company was legally registered in 2009. At that time, the company mainly engaged in the sale of cryogenic equipment and related equipment. Until 2013 the company acted as a dealer of import manufacturers on the territory of the Russian Federation. Because of the applications to work and intensions of the company managed to get into the Russian marketing area from manufacturers such as: Lupamat (Turkey) - a manufacturer of compressor equipment and Gazcon (Denmark) - one of the world's leading manufacturers of nitrogen and oxygen adsorption generators (currently part of the Atlas Copco group). Considering the growth of dealer participation in the marketing area , the company was actively seeking and attracting quality manufactures  abroad. The company's founders conducted technical audits among dozens of foreign manufacturing plants around the world, including countries such as France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Turkey, India, Singapore, Malaysia and China. During this time the company has gained invaluable experience of cooperation with foreign suppliers, has concluded and implemented many successful transactions. During many years of searching, the company's management decided to open its in-house fabrication on the territory of the Russian Federation, and in 2014 the first pressure swing adsorption nitrogen generator was produced by its own technology and on its own manufacturing area.</p>
